# Home Pie Django Server

Acts as a data aggregator and API to support my locally running Electron app, mobile app, and automated processes.

## What is Home Pie?

Home pie is basically a side project, built to monitor/support - my side projects ....

## Faqs & Stuff

- This repo is built for my private use and it is unique to my independent projects.
- This repo will always be in an unfinished state / mess, as there is no clear end goal, it is super low priority.
- It runs on my local network on a mini pc.

### My independent projects that this API supports:

- Time In Progress:
  Automated social media content generation and upload via API, based on progressbars (or brain rot ðŸ¤®),
  check out the instagram page - https://www.instagram.com/time.in.progress/
  website https://www.timeinprogress.com/

- Insta-Insights:
  Tracks multiple instagram accounts and their perfomance, good to compare my accounts performance against others within the same niche.

### Projects to add:

- Quixvert:
  An online file converter SAAS - https://www.quixvert.com/ (will deprecate soon).

- Micro Zombie WebGL game:
  A micro game built for my animation portfolio landing page. - https://www.louisrossouw.com/

- Mr-Ping-Ping:
  A simple python script that monitors / pings all my independent projects /health and /stats endpoints, records the data for Home Pie.

### Future Projects for Home Pie:

- Net worth monitor / calculator:
  todo: Save a list of all my assets owned, scrape the web to find the general resale value of each asset class & return data.
  Recharts graph in the electron app + mobile app

- Crypto:
  todo: Add a crypto section, connect to Valr API. Rebuild my DripDrip project and integrate it into Home Pie, (DripDrip is A automated dollar cost averaging bot). Add a section to easily record data for every purchase and sale, mostly for the tax man. some kind of stats would be fun.
